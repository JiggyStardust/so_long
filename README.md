SoLong: 42 school assignment about creating a simple 2D game using MiniLibX. I chose this project for it's simplicity and for fun. I considered making Fractol (visual project about creating fractals), but fractals make me dizzy.

Project start: 29.10.

Goal: Understand what this project and minilibx is about, create a Makefile and project folder.
